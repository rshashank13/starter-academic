üöÄ Summary (Who I am): Seasoned engineer üõ†Ô∏è | Machine Learning scientist üß† | Leader üåü

I am a Master of Science in Computer Science student at the University of Southern California (USC). My research interests primarily revolve around Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence Safety. In addition, I possess expertise in MLOps and have a proven track record of successfully implementing end-to-end ML pipelines, encompassing the entire journey from data preprocessing to production deployment at scale.

Currently, I hold the following positions:
1. <strong>Machine Learning Intern</strong> at the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html">Intel Corporation</a> (remote). In this role, I am actively involved in developing intelligent solutions aimed at optimizing patching procedures for Linux machines within the Engineering Compute's cloud offering.
2. <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> for the Fall 2023 offering of <a href="https://bytes.usc.edu/inf250/f23-DSci/home/index.html"> DSCI-250:Introduction to Data Science </a> under the guidance of <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Raghavachary/Saty">Prof. Sathyanarayan Raghavachary</a>. This role enables me to pursue my passion for teaching and contribute to enhancing the knowledge base of fellow students.
2. <strong>Student Researcher</strong> at the <a href="https://loni.usc.edu/"> Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) </a> at USC Keck School of Medicine, advised by Professor <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Duncan/Dominique"> Dominique Duncan</a>. In this capacity, I lead a team of 5 engineers for the NIH's <a href="https://dabi.loni.usc.edu/">Data Archive BRAIN Initiative (DABI)</a>. My focus is on spearheading the development of the analysis pipeline and various backend components.

<!-- Currently, I hold two positions at USC: 
1. Student Researcher in the Department of Chemistry at USC Dornsife, working under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/chemistry/vilesov/">Andrey Vilesov</a> where I am helping with the analysis of X-ray diffraction images of <em>He</em> bubbles using deep learning models.
2. Student Developer at the <a href="https://loni.usc.edu/"> Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) </a> at USC Keck School of Medicine, advised by Professor <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Duncan/Dominique"> Dominique Duncan </a> where I am part of the <a href="https://dabi.loni.usc.edu/home">Data Archive BRAIN Initiative (DABI)</a> developing an upcoming analytics pipeline for DABI. -->

Prior to joining USC, I gained valuable industry experience as a Software Engineer at both <a href="https://amazon.com"> Amazon Inc. </a> and <a href=""> Motorola Mobility </a>. During my tenure, I honed my skills in developing scalable software solutions, as well as developing AI systems for industrial applications. These experiences in the industry inspired me to pursue a master's degree specializing in AI, as I am passionate about understanding the principles behind the systems that govern major technological innovations in the modern world.

Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://sjce.ac.in"> SJCE Mysore</a>, where I was ranked third in the department for my outstanding performance.
