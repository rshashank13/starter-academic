# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: "In this paper, we have conducted a principled study of DNN training on Jetson accelerated edge devices. This exploration is the first of its kind. Our results confirm certain conventional wisdom and back them up with quantifiable metrics. But they also highlight counter-intuitive results which should help rethink system design and tuning for DNN workloads on such platforms."
