title: "[Paper Role Playing] Neural Word Embeddings as Implicit Matrix Factorization"
summary: "Presented the paper by Levy & Goldberg (2014), where my role as a teacher I ensured my students understood the mathematical grounding of why neural embeddings can be thought of as implicit matrix factorization, and explained key insights from the paper. I finally concluded with an intriguing application of neural word embedding algorithm (skip-gram model) for recommendation systems."
