title: "Fed-Exp: Federated Algorithm With An Exponential Weighted Average Approach"

summary: "We consider the problem of online learning in a federated setup. Here, the task for each edge-device/node is to learn the neural network in a federated fashion which performs well on the local data and as well captures the global trend by exploiting the statisitcal similarity of data available across different nodes in the network."
