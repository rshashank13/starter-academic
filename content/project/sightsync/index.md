title: "SightSync: Shazam for Video"
summary: "SightSync is a project that implements a Shazam-like functionality for video and audio clips. The system takes a database of videos, extracts frames and audio features, and stores them in Milvus vector database collections. It then allows users to search for a specific video or audio clip, finding the closest matches in both the visual and audio databases.
<br/><br/>
This project was done towards the coursework CSCI576: Multimedia Systems Design taught by Prof. Parag Havaldar in Fall 2023, at USC
