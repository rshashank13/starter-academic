title: "Identifying Deceptive Content: A Study on Clickbait and Fake News Detection"
summary: "The proliferation of fake news and clickbait articles on social media platforms has become a major concern for individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. To combat this issue, there is a need for effective models that can accurately detect these types of content. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of existing models for detecting fake news and clickbait, and study how the two problems are correlated by studying the predictions from these models. Our models have been trained and tested on a variety of publicly available datasets our conclusions show that models that detect fake news are to a certain extent reliable to make predictions on clickbait data as well.
