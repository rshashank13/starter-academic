title: "Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting"
summary: "Time series forecasting is the practice of using historical data to predict future values. It can be challenging, due to the complexity of time-series data and the difficulty of accurately modeling patterns and trends. In this project, we tackled the 'Store Sales- Time Series Forecasting' challenge on Kaggle, which involved forecasting sales at a grocery retailer in Ecuador. We trained multiple models, starting with linear regression as our baseline. After careful analysis, we improved upon the baseline and achieved an error score of 0.39525, a 13% improvement over our linear regression model."
