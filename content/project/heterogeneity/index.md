title: "Heterogeneity-Aware Hashing"
summary: "Hashing techniques are widely used in distributed storage applications. These applications run on node clusters which may typically vary in their computational and storage capacities. Uniform hashing functions that lie at the heart of the extant hashing techniques do not do justice to the heterogeneous nature of these node clusters as a result of which the allocation of keys to resources is not optimal. In this paper, we propose hashing techniques which specifically address the heterogeneity of node capacities. We also analyse the proposed techniques in the light of consistent hashing properties and present results of simulations performed based on the proposed techniques."
